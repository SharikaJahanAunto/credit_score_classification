## **Credit Score Prediction Project: Summary**

### **Problem Statement:**
As a data scientist in a global finance company, the objective is to develop a machine learning model that predicts individuals' credit scores based on their financial and credit-related data. The goal is to automate and enhance the credit scoring process using intelligent systems.

---

### **1. Dataset Overview:**
- The dataset contains features related to financial status, including **income**, **outstanding debt**, **credit history**, etc.
- The **target variable** is `Credit_Mix`, representing credit score categories.
  
Key Features:
- **Income**
- **Outstanding Debt**
- **Credit History**
- **Number of Credit Cards**
- **Loan Amount**
- **Age**

---

### **2. Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** was conducted to assess the distribution of features and the target variable.
- **Missing Values** were handled using imputation methods, and **outliers** were managed by applying standard deviation or IQR techniques.
- Categorical variables such as `Credit History` and `Credit_Mix` were encoded using label encoding or one-hot encoding as required.
- The **distribution of the target variable** was explored, identifying any class imbalances that might affect the model's performance.

---

### **3. Model Selection:**
Four machine learning classification models were selected to predict the credit scores:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest Classifier**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Gradient Boosting Classifier (e.g., XGBoost)**

These models were chosen based on their applicability to classification tasks, especially with imbalanced data.

---

### **4. Model Training:**
Each model was trained on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluation metrics used for performance assessment include:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

---

### **5. Hyperparameter Tuning:**
Hyperparameter tuning was performed using **Grid Search** or **Random Search** to optimize model performance. For example:
- **Random Forest**: Tuned parameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.
- **XGBoost**: Optimized learning rate, tree depth, and number of boosting rounds.

The tuning process was guided by cross-validation to ensure robust model performance.

---

### **6. Model Evaluation:**
After training, each model was evaluated on the test set using classification metrics. Key findings include:
- **Logistic Regression**: Good baseline performance but struggled with complex relationships.
- **Random Forest**: High accuracy and recall, but slower due to model complexity.
- **SVM**: Performed well on high-dimensional data but was computationally expensive.
- **XGBoost**: Showed the best balance between speed and accuracy, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

---

### **7. Interpretability:**
To interpret model decisions, feature importance was explored, particularly for tree-based models like **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**. This allowed us to understand which factors (e.g., income, outstanding debt) influenced the credit score classification the most.

---

### **Conclusion:**
- **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** emerged as the top models for predicting credit scores, with **XGBoost** having a slight edge due to faster computation and better handling of complex patterns.
- **Model interpretability** is crucial for financial applications to ensure that decisions are explainable to stakeholders.
- Proper handling of missing data, outliers, and feature encoding was critical in achieving good model performance.
